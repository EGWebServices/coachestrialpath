# **Demo Orientation**

---

Welcome to your demo of EduGuide online activities, designed to build core noncognitive, social-emotional skills that lead to higher achievement.

---

First, a little about us to introduce your demo. EduGuide is an award-winning, research-driven nonprofit. We have a mission to equip one million students to mentor their peers in core learning skills, so more and more people can overcome the obstacles they face on the path to their full potential.

**Attachment: EduGuide intro slide - jpg**
---

This is a 30-day sample of our evidence-based online training program to strengthen motivation and teach tactics for tackling challenges in and out of the classroom. Control group studies indicate these types of activities can measurably improve student attitudes, behavior, achievement and persistence. The program is delivered the way students learn best: in small, bite-sized pieces.

What questions do you have about the program?

COMMENT:
---

You can get answers to FAQ on our website.

---

To get the most out of your demo, we encourage you to take a moment to answer the questions for yourself. On this free, five-activity path, only EduGuide staff can see your comments. As you progress, they may discuss the activities with you. Otherwise, your responses are private. No other users can see what you write.

---

You’ll also see some demo content that is just for you, and not part of the student activities. This will be preceded by the phrase, “Demo Tip.”

---

How are you considering using EduGuide? In what courses and with what students?

**Comment:**
---

Now, let’s get started with EduGuide’s activities for students.

---

# **Your path to growth**

---

Hi, glad you’re here. This path is your personal space, where you can reflect and write without interruptions from other students who can’t see your comments. Only your group’s EduGuide coaches can see your comments. As you progress, they may discuss the activities with you.

---

Let’s check out this video from the 1992 Olympics about sprinting champion Derek Redmond.

**Attachment: Redmond Video.**
---

What do you think people admire about Derek Redmond in this video?

**Comment: Low: 10 Medium: 10 High: 10**
---
Many people say they admire Derek’s grit: the ability to stay focused on long term goals and overcome any obstacles that get in the way.

Grit enabled him to look pain in the face and persevere, not just in the race, but every day at practice when he pushed himself to go faster. It’s why people admire Derek Redmond so much. Even his failure brought out his greatness, because he never gave up. When things didn’t go as planned he was able to adapt and persist.

---

Thinking about your own life, how would you like to be more like Derek?

**Comment: Low: 10 Medium: 10 High: 10**

---

How would you like to be more like Derek’s father?** **

**Comment: Low: 10 Medium: 10 High: 10**
---

**Demo Tip: **Angela Duckworth at the University of Pennsylvania won the million dollar MacArthur Genius Award for developing a psychometric scale that measures a student’s grit level. She found that it’s a better predictor than IQ of student success. Even the smartest people can fall short of their potential if they’re not good at focusing on long-term goals, or if they give up or get distracted when they run into obstacles.

---
The activities you’ll do here each week are about helping you find your own path to greatness in life, no matter what you face. You’ll learn the strategies that athletes, performers and leaders in all walks of life use to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals — so you can achieve yours.

We call these strategies core learning skills. They are the core factors in how quickly you can learn to accomplish practically anything in school and life. And like core muscles, they give you strength to stand up to challenges.
---

Ultimately, these activities are about equipping you to help others find their greatness, too, just like Derek’s father did for his son through the years.

---

This path will train you to mentor people around you as part of your daily life: friends, family members and others.

You’ll learn the keys to helping people grow to their potential, which is what mentoring is all about.You’ll also be given regular opportunities to improve your mentoring skills. You’ll practice by mentoring a character named “Quinn.” You can picture Quinn as a younger version of yourself.
---

**Demo Tip:** EduGuide is not just about making students stronger, individually. It’s about training them in how to informally mentor others in the skills research shows can help them reach their goals. They grow even more by learning how they can contribute to their families and communities. 

---

It won’t always be easy, but the more effort you put into thinking about these activities, the faster you’ll grow to realize the fullness of what you were meant to be. It’s going to be a rewarding journey.** **

**Attachments.**
---

So, let’s get started mentoring by giving Quinn a little advice. Imagine you could write a note to yourself when you were younger; what would you say?** **

**Comment: Low: 15 Medium: 15 High: 15**
---

**Challenge:** In each activity, we share one challenge you can choose to take on if you want to see greater growth. This week, don’t try to change anything. But as you or others run into obstacles, think about what Derek Redmond would do if he were in your shoes.

---

**Feedback**: Hi, we’re always seeking to improve, just like you. So, as a new member, we would like to get your first impressions: How would you describe EduGuide to a friend?

# **Your Mind is Like a Muscle**

---

By now, you’ve learned a couple things about EduGuide:

        1. EduGuide is your space to reflect on your personal growth plan: how you decide you want to grow and help others to grow. Other students can’t see your comments.
        2. Your group’s EduGuide coaches will follow your progress. They may reply to your writing from time to time with additional questions or advice to help you reach your goals.

---

These are some ways our partners report that EduGuide benefits their students. What would be most important to you, to help your students?** **

**Comment: Low: 3 Medium: 3 High: 3**
**Attachment: Student Impact jpg.**
---

So, let’s start learning how to mentor others in core learning skills. These skills empower people to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals. A good place to begin is by understanding how our brains work.

---

Researchers have discovered that your mind is like a muscle: the more you exercise it, the stronger it grows.

** Attachment: Video.**
---

Think of how toddlers learn to talk. They make lots of mistakes; you can hardly understand them at first.

But by working at it again and again, their minds grow to master the language. All that exercise builds up the brain so it’s ready for the next level of challenges: like how to use words they’ve learned to persuade other kids to let them play ball.
---

Think about the last few years of your own life. What are a few things that you weren’t very good at to start, but got better at with practice?** **

**Comment: Low: 3 Medium: 3 High: 3**
---

Video games are a great example of how the brain grows with exercise.You make lots of mistakes at first, but as you play the game over and over, you train your brain to grow to each new level. That’s what makes video games so fun: your brain loves to be pushed to grow. That also explains why easy games get boring.

---

Let’s take a closer look at how your brain grows new connections as you learn new things.

---

In the video, what are 3 or more ways that learning something new is like building a path across a canyon? (You can re-watch the video to find them.)** **

**Attachments.**** **
**Comment: Low: 20 Medium: 20 High: 20**
---

Often learning something new looks beyond our reach. Our first attempts are the hardest. We make mistakes. But the more we work at it, the stronger we build the neural pathway in our brain, and the easier it gets. Eventually we can do it whenever we want; it’s as natural to us as walking.

---

What’s another comparison you could make for learning? (For example, learning is like riding a bike. It’s scary at first, and you’re going to fall a lot, but if you keep practicing, eventually it’s easy, and it gives you freedom to go more places faster.) What else is learning like?** **

**Comment: Low: 20 Medium: 20 High: 20**
---

Now let’s practice mentoring. Remember Quinn? Quinn is a younger version of yourself. Quinn hasn't learned about how the brain creates new neural connections.

Use what you learned from the video to help Quinn understand what to do when experiencing problems learning something new.** **
**Comment: Low: 20 Medium: 20 High: 20**
---

**Demo Tip:** When students answer questions such as these, it’s an opportunity for a mentor to jump in and ask a follow up question. If you’re not sure how to respond, EduGuide’s Results Coaches will help you learn to ask good questions to help students dig deeper and give advice to others.

**Attachment: screenshot of student-teacher conversation.**
---

The way to tell your muscles to grow is to give them exercises that push them beyond the limit of what’s easy to do now.That’s why we say, “no pain, no gain.” The muscle fibers actually get micro-tears in them, and the body responds by rebuilding them stronger to handle more exercise. In the same way, when you stretch your brain with new challenges, you tell your brain to start making new connections so it can handle more next time.

---

“No pain, no gain” is also why you’ll find that we ask you a lot of questions in these activities. Some may even seem repetitive, just like exercise can be. We do that because it’s easy to take in information. But it’s only as our mind does the heavy lifting of thinking and writing about it that we actually get to grow from it.

What’s something that you found fun to learn to do even though it was hard?

# **Your EduGuides**

By now, you know EduGuide is a private space where coaches can work with you as you reflect on how you want to grow to accomplish your goals. But did you know that an EduGuide is also a person?

---

**Demo Tip:** If you work directly with students, you’re probably an EduGuide, yourself. EduGuide (the organization) is all about facilitating that role. On the back end of our platform, you can watch in real time as your students’ responses come in. 

---

Our nonprofit’s founder named the organization in honor of the many people who helped him find his way: people who mentored him, inspired him, and brought out his best. That’s what an EduGuide is.** **

**Attachments.**
---

In what ways was EduGuide’s founder helped by his counselor, Mrs. Troy?** **

**Attachments.**** Comment: Low: 10 Medium: 10 High: 10**
---

Think for a moment about your own life. Who has encouraged, inspired or mentored you? Who has brought out your best? Who has helped you become who you are? Who has been your EduGuide?Take some time to look back through your whole life to find these people. Write about 3 or more who, in big ways or small, have helped you find your way.

For each person, write 3 things:

        1. Their name.
        2. One specific moment you remember, when they did or said something that helped you.
        3. What you learned from that.


**Example:** My mom. Took me with her to visit the elderly. I learned to care for others and to talk to people I didn’t know. It forced me to leave my comfort zone; I can still see their smiles and hers.** **

**Comment: Low: 20 Medium: 20 High: 20**

---

Pause and take a breath. Try to identify each of the feelings that came to you as you remembered these moments when people helped you. Close your eyes to help you focus. How would you describe those feelings?


**Comment: Low: 5 Medium: 5 High: 5**

---

When people take time to reflect on the EduGuides who’ve helped them, often they will say things like: “I felt touched, warm, emotional, moved.” Or “it made me feel special and grateful.” Or “I felt lighter, more open, relaxed and hopeful.” Sometimes they’ll even talk about being able to feel the same excitement and energy they felt in that moment, long ago, that they are remembering.

---

Researchers have found that these feelings are grounded in real changes. Just by thinking about what people have done for us, our bodies actually change to what is called the “renewal mode,” a state that reduces stress, re-energizes us and promotes growth. And it does something else too: it changes us.

---

Psychologist Dr. Richard Boyatzis asked business leaders to provide detailed descriptions of specific moments when someone else had brought out their best, kind of like what you just did. Weeks later, the researchers met with the leaders again and connected them to brain imaging scanners. Then they read back to the leaders what they had said about the people who influenced them.

What guesses do you have about the changes in the leaders’ brain activity, when they heard what they had said before?** Comment:**
---

Recalling their EduGuides not only made them feel better, it also activated what’s called the “Mirror Neuron Networks.” These networks in our brains are what enable us to imitate the behavior of others. In other words, when we think about the people who inspire us, our brains actually start reshaping to become more like those people.

---

You can see the Mirror Neuron Network in action with this baby monkey imitating the man’s facial expression. But what researchers saw for the first time with the group of business leaders was how just recalling the actions of people who inspire them could still reshape their brains, in some cases even decades after the event. Knowing that, who else would you like to become more like by reflecting on how they’ve touched your life?** **

# 
**Fixed vs. Growth Mindset**

As we discussed earlier, researchers have shown that your mind is like a muscle. The more you exercise it, the stronger it grows.** Attachments.**

---

Let’s think more about exercise, because the way you exercise your mind matters as much as how often you exercise it. One key factor is your mindset: the attitude and beliefs that shape how you look at the world.

---

It’s common for our mindset to change based on what happens to us. When we have a bad day, it affects our mindset: the world looks gloomier and we react.

---

But you can also be proactive. When you want to, you can choose to change your mindset and over time gain greater control over it. In the next video, try to figure out what kind of mindset the athlete has chosen despite the obstacles he faces.

---

What are 3 signs that he has developed a mindset that he can grow his ability no matter what? (You can re-watch the video to find them.)** **

**Attachments.**** Comment: Low: 10 Medium: 10 High: 10**
---

Stanford researcher Dr. Carol Dwek discovered that those who learn to approach life with a “growth” mindset, learn faster and more freely than those with a “fixed,” or some would say “stuck,” mindset.That’s true not only in school, but in sports, work and even relationships. So what’s the difference between a “growth” vs. a “fixed” mindset?

---

Well, when people have a “fixed” mindset, they believe they are stuck with a set amount of talent. They think they can’t grow to meet new challenges. And they think that if they make mistakes or have to work hard at something, it means they must be dumb or weak.

---

But people with a growth mindset understand that their intelligence and skills grow with exercise over time, so they’re not afraid to try new things. Mistakes are just part of the process.

---

When people are stuck with a fixed mindset, they often avoid challenges that might show their weakness. If they’re playing a sport, they try to stick to easy things they’ve already mastered. If they’re in school, they try to avoid subjects that are hard for them.

---

But people with a growth mindset know that you can’t get stronger by lifting feathers; you get stronger by pushing yourself to your limit.

---

They know that if something is easy for you, you’re not learning much. To grow your mind, you need to find things that are challenging and then keep working at them to build new neural connections in your brain.

---

In your own words, what would you say to help your friends understand the difference between being stuck with a fixed mindset and having a growth mindset?** Comment: Low: 10 Medium: 10 High: 10**

---

The good news is that with practice, you can change your mindset over time. And when you do, you’ll grow stronger…and freer.

---

The first step is to recognize the fixed mindset voice in your head when you hear it.

---

Let’s practice by mentoring Quinn again. Picture Quinn as someone who’s a lot like you, just slightly younger.

---

Quinn often struggles between two voices in his head.The fixed mindset voice avoids challenges, because it’s afraid of failure. So, when Quinn’s teacher asks for a volunteer to answer a question, the fixed mindset voice will say, “Keep your mouth shut, and you’ll be safe.”

---

In your own words, what else do you think the fixed mindset voice might say to get Quinn to avoid the challenge?** Comment: Low: 10 Medium: 10 High: 10**

---

You can often tell the fixed mindset because it speaks from fear and is focused on looking smart.It will say things such as, “Are you sure you can do it? You don’t want to look dumb.”

---

But Quinn’s growth mindset voice embraces challenges, even when they’re a little scary. That’s because it knows that tackling challenges is the only way to grow.So Quinn’s growth mindset will say, “I’m not sure what the answer is, but if I try, even if I’m wrong, I’ll remember the correct answer better.”

---

In your own words, what else do you think the growth mindset could say to encourage Quinn to try?** Comment: Low: 10 Medium: 10 High: 10**

---

The growth mindset isn’t fearless, but it doesn’t let fears get in the way of growing stronger.It will say things such as, “Let’s give it a try. So what if people see me make mistakes, I’ll be stronger if I work at it.”

---

How about you: when do you hear the fixed mindset in your head?** Comment: Low: 10 Medium: 10 High: 10**

# **Your core purpose**

---

In this activity, we’re going to reflect on the world and the kind of person you want to be in it.

---

The world is sometimes unjust. How could it be better? Many students say they would like to see less violence, pollution or poverty. How about you? How would you like the world to be a better place?** Comment: Low: 10 Medium: 10 High: 10**

---

When you’re younger, everything gets decided for you. But as you get older, you make more decisions on your own about what you think is important. You start to take charge of your future and the role you want to play in the world. You realize that you’re responsible for choosing the kind of person you want to be. One decision students make is what they’re going to work hard on. Most everyone works hard at school sometimes, but why do students choose to work hard? What do they want to get out of school?

---

When asked in surveys, some students talk about getting a good job and making money. But that’s seldom what they say is the main reason. They also talk about wanting to be an educated person who has something intelligent to say about what’s going on in the world. And most say that they work hard for more personal reasons that they seldom discuss with friends.

---

When they are asked to think about what gets them through bad days, difficult assignments, and loads of homework, most students talk about having a deeper sense of purpose for their life that they may even have a hard time putting into words. That core purpose gives their life a sense of meaning to push on, even when it gets hard.

---

Students often talk about making life better for their family or being a role model for others. Some talk about wanting to serve their country or make their community a better place. Others talk about creating things or glorifying God.** Attachments.**

---

**Demo Tip: **Check out this example of core purpose expressed in a creative video by the winner of the 2015 EduGuide Challenge scholarship competition, Brian Ball.** Attachment: Brian Ball video.**

---

It’s worth taking some time to reflect on your own core purpose. You may still be forming it. And it may change over time as you come to see it more clearly. But you start to discover it by just asking a few questions and seeing where the answers lead.** Attachments.**

---

First, how will learning in school help you become the person you want to be, fulfilling your core purpose? We’re not asking about things like fame and fortune, even though those can be important too. But rather, how what you learn helps you to become someone who has a positive impact on the people around you or the world in general?** Comment: Low: 20 Medium: 20 High: 20**

---

Let’s dig a little deeper. Picture what specific differences you could make for yourself and others by fulfilling your core purpose?** Comment: Low: 10 Medium: 10 High: 10**

Finally, take a minute to imagine fulfilling your purpose: how would that make you feel?** Comment: Low: 10 Medium: 10 High: 10**

---

**Demo Tip:** Here’s another offline, printable blended learning activity you can use to build on EduGuide concepts, or to introduce core purpose to a class for the first time. Try it out with your students, and let us know how it goes.**Attachment: Core Purpose activity.**

---

Speaking of purpose, we’ll let you in on ours. At EduGuide, our core purpose is to help people take new steps to realize the fullness of what they can contribute to the world. It’s why we come to work every morning. And it’s so much more important than money to us that we organized ourselves as a nonprofit so all our attention can be invested in making a difference.

---

We’re honored to partner with you in pursuing your core purpose. And we’re excited about the difference you’ll make by learning to mentor others, so that they develop their potential to contribute to the world too. Speaking of which…
